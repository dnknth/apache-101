# Apache 101

This is a short series about Apache web server configuration. Why yet another howto series? Apache is not *that* complicated and well described all over the web.

I've used Apache for more than 20 years, both professionally and for hobby projects. The basic options are quite easy to understand, but a fast and secure website requires quite a few settings that are not included in the factory defaults. Here are some best practices that have evolved over time.

## Contents

* The [first post](basic-configuration.md) explains the basic  configuration layout and required modules
* next we go into [security and SSL](security.md),
* [part 3](static-resources.md) dicusses techniques to efficiently serve static content,
* [part 4](pretty-directory-listings.md) adds some eye candy, and
* the [last post](svn.md) is a bonus piece about browsing Subversion repositories in style (if you still use them). 

Have fun!
